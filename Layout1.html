          Forests are being wiped out and trees are being cut down at a rapid
          rate. To meet the other needs of humans, we are losing sight of the
          bigger picture. People need to take steps to improve the forest cover
          rather than decrease it. The government must regulate the cutting down
          of trees. We must adopt roper methods which ensure the regrowth of
          trees. This way, we will be able to fulfill both the needs.
          Furthermore, we must control forest fires. We must adopt the latest
          techniques which will help in fire fighting more efficiently. This
          will prevent further loss of trees and animals. Most importantly,
          afforestation plus reforestation must be practiced. The people and
          government must plant new trees in place of the one cut down.
          Moreover, they must plant trees in new areas to develop a forest. In
          short, forests are a great blessing of nature. Various types of
          forests are home to a thousand animals and also means of livelihood
          for numerous people. We must recognize the importance of forests and
          take proper measures to tackle the issue of deforestation.
